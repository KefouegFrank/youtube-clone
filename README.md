As a complete beginner, I embarked on a journey to grasp the foundations of web development by diving into HTML and CSS. I stumbled upon an incredibly beginner-friendly video course that turned out to be a game-changer. Here's a brief summary of the key techniques and insights I gained:

1. **HTML Structure**: Understanding how to structure HTML was like learning the alphabet for web development. It's the backbone of every web page, and knowing how to organize content using tags and elements is crucial.

2. **Nested Layout Technique**: This technique introduced me to the power of nesting elements within each other. It's like building with LEGO bricks, allowing for complex and structured layouts with ease.

3. **Display Property**: Learning how to control the display property unlocked a world of possibilities. It's like having different tools in your toolbox to arrange elements horizontally, vertically, or in any desired configuration.

4. **Grid System**: Grids are the secret sauce of responsive web design. Understanding how to create grid layouts gave me the ability to design visually appealing and well-organized web pages effortlessly.
